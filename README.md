# The steps

- We are going to start with these four items.
    - A piece of 2x4
    - A piece of paper towel
    - Clamp
    - The lid of the container
- First fold the paper towel into a square and place it on top of the lid.
- Loosen up the clamp and hold down the paper towel and lid combo firmly and not too tide.
- Take out the drill and power it up.
    - Drill
- While that's drilling, don't drill too fast as the glass might shader. Take it nice and slow.
- Unclamp the setup and repeat process on the diagonal side of the lid.
- Now, the two holes are drilled. Remove the pinter's tape from the lid.
- Take a bit of plastic tubing and thread it over one of the holes on the lid.
    - Plastic tubing
- Make sure to leave out about `2 inches` on the inside of the lid.
- Next take out your best hot glue gun. Use it to seal off the hole from outside of the lid.
    - Hot glue gun
- Make sure your willing participate have platy of room and make sure the lid is water tide.
    - Fish tank and Fish(optional)
- Take out rock filter thingie and solar powered pump.
- Connect the rock thingie from the inside of the lid and the pump from the outside of the lid.
    - Solar pump
    - Rock filter
- Seal up the lid and make sure the filter is on the bottom of the tank.
- Press it down firmly on the lid and close up the sealing clips.
- Flip it over and it's done.
- Just for the bonus feature, I decided to 3D print a stand for the fish tank.
    - 3D printed stand(optional)
